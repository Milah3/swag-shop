# Swag-Shop Web Store

Basic introduction to React - Built a simple one page website that allows user to add and remove items from their wishlists. Can retrieve products from the backend API using MongoDB, and render them onto the page, and then allow users to add them to their wishlists.

## Tools & Technologies Used

    Frontend:
        React (v8.15)
        Javascript

    Backend:
        MongoDB
        Expressjs
        Nodejs

### Core Concepts Covered

    1. React States & Props and how to pass them
    2. Function Components - JS uses mostly functional components, so learned a bit more how they work.
    3. Event Handling
    4. Custom Singleton Services - (Data Service & Notification Services)
    5. Class components
    6. useEffect Hook - got a better grasp of how this works.
    7. Refs - Still need more practice with this one, but it was quite useful.

## Potential Next Steps

[ ] Connect to an live api to get data it accurate data
[ ] Reflect wishlist changes to the backend API
